# First-Program
My first program uploaded to GitHub.
I'm a new programmer and I am proud of my first program that is being uploaded on GitHub. I enjoy problem solving and developing programs that will add value to peoples lives. As I grow and get better, the programs will get better. I'm a graduate of The Ohio State University and am an avid runner.
